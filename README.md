# Handwritten-Character-Recognition

Here we will illustrate or demonstrate handwritten character recognition system using CNN model.

Abstract
An attempt is made to recognize handwritten characters for English alphabets using multilayer Feed Forward neural network. Kaggle dataset which consists of English alphabets and is in the form of .csv type are made use of to train the neural network. The feature extraction technique is obtained by normalizing the pixel values. Pixel values will range from 0 to 255 which represents the intensity of each pixel in the image and they are normalized to represent value between 0 and 1. Convolutional neural network is used as a classifier which trains the Kaggle dataset.
